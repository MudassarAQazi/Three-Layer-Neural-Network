# Three Layer Neural Network on CIFAR-10 Dataset

<br>This repository contains 4 different model files for image classifications of CIFAR-10 Dataset.
<br>The settings for 2 hyperparameters named as Learning Rate and Regularization are made. 

<br>i.   SciKitLearn based Two Layer Neural Network.
<br>ii.  From Scratch Three Layer Neural Network.
<br>iii. Keras based Three Layer Neural Network.
<br>iv.  SciKitLearn based Three Layer Neural Network.
